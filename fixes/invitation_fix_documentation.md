# QR Code Invitation Link Fix

## Issue Description
Users were encountering "Failed to join chat: Invitation not found" errors when attempting to use QR code invitation links.

## Root Causes

After analyzing the codebase, we identified the following issues:

1. **Incorrect API Endpoint Configuration**: The API client was using incorrect endpoint URLs for invitation operations:
   - `/chats/generate-invitation` instead of `/api/chats/generate-invitation`
   - `/chats/invitation-status/{token}` instead of `/api/chats/invitation-status/{token}`
   - `/chats/accept-invitation/{token}` instead of `/api/chats/accept-invitation/{token}`

2. **Content-Type Header Issues**: The API requests weren't consistently setting the Content-Type header to 'application/json'.

3. **Inadequate Error Logging**: The error handling in the join_chat endpoint didn't provide enough diagnostic information.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed API Endpoint Configuration**:
   - Updated the ApiClient.config.endpoints.chats.invitation settings in `frontend/static/js/services/api-client.js` to use the correct `/api/chats/...` paths

2. **Enhanced QR Code URL Creation**:
   - Improved the QRCodeGenerator.createInvitationURL method to ensure proper URL formation and added logging

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced the join_chat function in api_gateway/app.py with better logging and diagnostics
   - Added redirection to the test-join endpoint when errors occur for better debugging

4. **Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Created a debugging utility at `fixes/invitation_debugger.js` to help diagnose QR code invitation issues
   - This script can be run in the browser console to test the invitation generation and status checking

## Testing the Fix

1. Run the debugging utility in the browser console:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/fixes/invitation_debugger.js').then(r => r.text()).then(code => eval(code))
   ```

2. Generate a test invitation:
   ```javascript
   testInvitationGeneration()
   ```

3. Check a specific invitation token:
   ```javascript
   checkInvitationToken('your-token-here')
   ```

## Technical Details

The invitation flow now correctly:
1. Generates a token with a POST to `/api/chats/generate-invitation`
2. Creates a QR code pointing to `/join/{token}` 
3. When scanning the QR code, the join handler calls `/api/chats/accept-invitation/{token}`
4. Proper Content-Type headers ensure all these API calls work correctly

These fixes ensure that the invitation mechanism works across both development and production environments.
